But, I'm trying to stay positive-met a friend today. His name is Phlem. He is just so happy about everything. I'm trying to be more like him. Well have to get going our wagon leaves tomorrow for Oregon!

It's Phelm...ugh...I know he was super happy and I liked that, but now it's getting to be way too much. He asked me to see my snake-yea!
